Well this project is close to my heart, I am sick of frameworks and abstraction layers, sometimes it feels like I am punching air using nodejs to build a backend, like I don't know anything how things are working underneath and just slapping code and hoping it to work.


So in this project I am trying to understand building backend with GO for a web application by implementing auth with jwt and go!
